# Azure-Databricks-Interview-Preparation-with-Real-Time-Scenarios

This module focuses on Azure Databricks interview questions and hands-on, real-world scenarios to help you build both conceptual understanding and practical expertise in data engineering with Azure.

You’ll start with an Azure Data Lake and Azure Databricks Tutorial, learning how these two services integrate seamlessly for building scalable data pipelines. From there, we dive deep into Databricks Unity Catalog, which provides centralized data governance, access control, and metadata management across workspaces.

Through practical PySpark implementations, you’ll learn how to ingest data from Azure Data Lake, perform incremental data loading using Autoloader, and manage schema evolution with Spark Structured Streaming.

You’ll also gain in-depth knowledge of Delta Tables, exploring features like Data Versioning and Time Travel to enable rollback, auditing, and historical data analysis. Additionally, you’ll master key Spark Optimization techniques to improve performance, minimize data skew, and maximize cluster efficiency.

This module is designed not only to strengthen your technical interview preparation but also to prepare you for real-world Azure Databricks use cases commonly encountered in data engineering roles.
